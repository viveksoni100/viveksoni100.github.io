          <h3>Because... Linux is faster: <i>get every ounce of your CPU power working for you</i>
          </h3>
          <p> Yes. Linux is faster, and there is technical explanation for that. The core thing that make Linux faster
            than windows is its ‘core’. When I say core, I mean the Kernel. Linux follows a monolithic styled Kernel,
            that means the critical OS functionality such as driver management, memory management, task scheduler and
            the file systems, all are available at one place only, that make the communication between them faster.
            Windows is using Kernel which is micro Kernel. Micro Kernels contain fewer functionality with it. The other
            aspects are loaded separately in Window’s micro Kernel.</p>

          <h3>Because... Linux has many flavors: <i>give a purpose to your computer</i></h3>
          <p> My professor uses a very good analogy to explain Linux Distributions.
            Imagine when very first ice cream was invented, how would it look and taste like! Imagine that was a plain
            vanilla ice cream. That plain vanilla ice cream is Linux. Later on people started adding flavours to their
            choices, like Chocolate, Strawberry etc. Similarly on top of Linux Kernel, developers added tools and
            software that are aligned to their profession or purpose. If you’re interested in hacking, there is Kali
            Linux for you. If you want super security, there is SE Linux (Security-Enhanced) for you. If you are network
            administrator, then there is CentOS Linux for you. This and that there are hundreds of Linux Distributions
            available for your purpose of work. To explore the ocean of distros visit www.distrowatch.com</p>

          <h3>Because... Linux has wide support community / forums / websites / videos:
            <i>individually we are drop but together we are ocean</i>
          </h3>
          <p> Let me tell you an incident. Once I was working on one .NET project, where I encountered serious error (it
            was not generating .exe file under any circumstances), when I searched on internet regarding the error,
            there was no gentleman answer for that, in fact what people do to just get clicks was this, they first write
            rubbish which contain the error in title but inside, they just talk round round, and at last they say, to
            solve this error visit this link. And when you click to that link another person talk same rubbish, and at
            last he too put a link to visit. No matter how much you try to catch your tail, you just can’t do it. Well
            this happens because windows is proprietary OS, this is why they can’t solve our problem without charging
            nothing from us. On the other hand in Linux it is too good, when you try to search for an error solution,
            you would literally astonished the way they (community pages and forums) define and get root to the error.
            This is something you only understand when you start troubleshooting for Linux errors.</p>

          <h3>Because... Linux is not stalking you: <i>solitude sometimes is the best society</i></h3>
          <p> Linux don’t collect user data whereas windows collect all the user details which lead to privacy breach.
          </p>

          <h3>Because... Linux is as secure as an English castle: <i>Security is always excessive
              until it's not enough</i></h3>
          <p> On this mother Earth, 87.56% desktop users use Windows as their primary OS, 9.65% uses macOS and 2.15%
            ‘elite force people’ uses Linux. So it make more sense for hackers to create Virus that target Windows OS.
            In addition to that Linux architecture is designed the way that makes the job of Virus to break through damn
            difficult. Getting into detail about architecture is out of the scope here. According to www.top500.org in
            the year 2019 all top 500 servers/super computers uses Linux operating system as their primary os, this
            highlight the power of Linux.</p>

          <h3>Because... Linux offers quality open source software and tools: <i>In fact, the
              software gives us the tools to fill our evolutionary roles</i></h3>
          <p> There are plenty of open source software available on Linux, and they’re pretty bomb at performing. For an
            instance, for youtube video download, there is youtube-dl tools, it offers very good functionality such as,
            it can download entire playlist, it can extract audio from the video and make it mp3, this and many other so
            many powerful function youtube-dl has. Then there is openSSL tool, it can encrypt any document in almost all
            type of encryption modes. It works miraculously fine for developer tools like Android Studio, Github,
            PyCharm, Docker, PHP, JavaScript etc.</p>

          <h3>Because... Linux unleash the lethal tech geek in you: <i>Linux can do everything
              Windows can, and figuring out how, is funnn!</i></h3>
          <p> Initially problem comes when you newly start working with Linux, because in Linux there is so much
            commands you need to fire in its terminal. You might blow your mind sometimes, in fact Linux will challenge
            you on day to day operations. But trust me there is no satisfaction then you solve a Linux problem by
            throughing its forum or you read book or watch tutorials or anyhow if you nailed it, you will get a sound
            sleep that night. :)</p>

          <p><i><b>CAUTION!,</b> once you survived first 6 months with Linux, then there is no chance you getting back
              to Windows or Mac ever again.</i></p>
